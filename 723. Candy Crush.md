### 1. **Crushing Candies (Identifying Cells to Crush)**

- For each cell in the board, we need to check:
  - **Horizontally**: We only need to check the leftmost cell of a horizontal sequence (e.g., `(i, j)` for the start of a horizontal sequence). If a sequence of three or more identical candies exists horizontally, we mark them for removal.
  - **Vertically**: Similarly, we only need to check the topmost cell of a vertical sequence (e.g., `(i, j)` for the start of a vertical sequence). If a sequence of three or more identical candies exists vertically, we mark them for removal.

- In each direction (horizontal or vertical), we only need to traverse **one sequence** of the connected cells (not the entire row or column).

So, for each cell, we only check its **immediate neighbors** in the horizontal and vertical directions.

### Time Complexity of Identifying Crushable Candies:

- **Horizontal check**: For each cell, the horizontal check takes **O(1)** time since we just need to look at the adjacent right cells.
- **Vertical check**: Similarly, the vertical check takes **O(1)** time because we just need to look at the adjacent downward cells.

Therefore, the total time complexity for identifying all crushable candies for **all cells** is **O(m * n)** because we iterate over each cell exactly once, and for each, we check its horizontal and vertical neighbors in constant time.

### 2. **Crushing Candies**

After identifying the candies that need to be crushed, we set them to zero. As previously mentioned, there can be up to **O(m * n)** cells to crush, so the time complexity for this operation is **O(m * n)**.

### 3. **Dropping Candies**

The dropping operation is performed on the columns that were affected by the crush operation. We iterate through each affected column from bottom to top, and for each column, the dropping operation takes **O(m)** time.

Thus, the time complexity for the dropping operation is **O(m * n)**.

### 4. **Recursive Calls**

After crushing and dropping candies, we call the `candyCrush` method recursively until no more candies can be crushed. In the worst case, we could have **O(m * n)** recursive calls, but in practice, this number is typically much smaller since the board stabilizes after a few crushes.

### Final Time Complexity:

- **Identifying crushable candies**: **O(m * n)**
- **Crushing candies**: **O(m * n)**
- **Dropping candies**: **O(m * n)**
- **Recursive calls**: Up to **O(m * n)** calls in the worst case

Thus, the overall time complexity for the entire process is:

\[
O((m * n) * k)
\]

where `k` is the number of recursive calls needed to stabilize the board. In the worst case, `k` can be as large as **O(m * n)**, but in most cases, it will be much smaller.

### Conclusion:

So, the time complexity of this solution is primarily **O(m * n)** for each recursion, and in the worst case, it could be **O((m * n)²)** if the board keeps getting reset repeatedly for a large number of recursive steps.
