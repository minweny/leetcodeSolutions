                heapq.heappush(heap, h)
            else:
                remove[-h] += 1
            
            while heap and heap[0] in remove:
                remove[heap[0]] -= 1
                if remove[heap[0]] == 0:
                    del remove[heap[0]]
                heapq.heappop(heap)

            # print(x, h, heap, remove)

            curHei = -heap[0]
            if not res or res[-1][1] != curHei:
                # print([x, curHei])
                res.append([x, curHei])
        return res

Why using set to lazy remove doesn't work? Set doesn't track how many times to remove a height value. There can be multiple heights with same value to remove.

Consider this test case. buildings =
[[1,2,1],[1,2,2],[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[2,3,2],[2,3,3]]
