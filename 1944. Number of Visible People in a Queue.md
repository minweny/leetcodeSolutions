```

Let's analyze the code you've provided and test it with the given input `heights = [10, 6, 8, 5, 4, 11]`.

### Code Explanation:
The problem you're trying to solve seems to be about determining how many people each person can see ahead of them in a line, where they can only see people who are shorter than them until they encounter a taller person, who blocks the view.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how your code works:

1. **Initialize variables**:
   - `n = len(heights)` gives the number of people.
   - `ans = [0] * n` initializes a result list where each entry will store the number of people a given person can see.
   - `st = []` is a stack used to track the heights of people as we process them from right to left.

2. **Processing the heights**:
   - The `for` loop iterates from right to left (from the last person to the first).
   - In each iteration, it checks how many people the current person can see by popping people from the stack who are shorter than the current person. For each such pop, the current person can see one more person.
   - If thereâ€™s still a person left on the stack (who is taller than the current person), then the current person can see exactly one more person (the one on top of the stack).
   - The height of the current person is then pushed onto the stack.

3. **Return the result**:
   - Finally, the list `ans` is returned, containing the number of people each person can see ahead of them.

### Test Case: `heights = [10, 6, 8, 5, 4, 11]`

Let's walk through the execution step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `heights = [10, 6, 8, 5, 4, 11]`
   - `n = 6`, `ans = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, `st = []`

2. **Iteration** (Right to Left):

   - `i = 5` (Person with height 11):
     - Stack is empty, so no one is popped. `ans[5]` remains 0.
     - Push 11 onto the stack: `st = [11]`.

   - `i = 4` (Person with height 4):
     - Stack is not empty, but 4 is shorter than 11 (stack top), so increment `ans[4]` by 1 (they can see 1 person).
     - Push 4 onto the stack: `st = [11, 4]`.

   - `i = 3` (Person with height 5):
     - 5 is taller than 4 (stack top), so pop 4 and increment `ans[3]` by 1.
     - Now 5 is shorter than 11 (next in stack), so increment `ans[3]` by 1 (they can see 1 more person).
     - Push 5 onto the stack: `st = [11, 5]`.

   - `i = 2` (Person with height 8):
     - 8 is taller than 5 (stack top), so pop 5 and increment `ans[2]` by 1.
     - Now 8 is shorter than 11 (next in stack), so increment `ans[2]` by 1.
     - Push 8 onto the stack: `st = [11, 8]`.

   - `i = 1` (Person with height 6):
     - 6 is shorter than 8 (stack top), so increment `ans[1]` by 1 (they can see 1 person).
     - Push 6 onto the stack: `st = [11, 8, 6]`.

   - `i = 0` (Person with height 10):
     - 10 is taller than 6 (stack top), so pop 6 and increment `ans[0]` by 1.
     - 10 is taller than 8 (next in stack), so pop 8 and increment `ans[0]` by 1.
     - Now 10 is shorter than 11 (next in stack), so increment `ans[0]` by 1.
     - Push 10 onto the stack: `st = [11, 10]`.

3. **Result**:
   After the loop finishes, `ans = [3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]`, which means:

   - The person at index 0 (height 10) can see 3 people ahead (he sees the person with height 6, 8, and 5).
   - The person at index 1 (height 6) can see 1 person ahead (he sees only the person with height 5).
   - The person at index 2 (height 8) can see 2 people ahead (he sees the person with height 5 and 4).
   - The person at index 3 (height 5) can see 1 person ahead (he sees the person with height 4).
   - The person at index 4 (height 4) can see 1 person ahead (he sees no one, because 4 is the shortest).
   - The person at index 5 (height 11) cannot see anyone because no one is taller than 11.

### Conclusion:
Yes, your code works correctly for the input `heights = [10, 6, 8, 5, 4, 11]`, and the output will be:

```python
[3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]
```
